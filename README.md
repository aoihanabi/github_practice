# Github Practice Project  ðŸ§©
This is a super simple project I use to mess around with some git & github functionalities. It started from Git and Github course from Platzi. You can [**check it out here**](https://platzi.com/cursos/git-github/)

## This are some of the main topics covered in the course:
* What is Git and how to install it
* Git commands.
* Basic workflow with Git
* Remote repositories with Github
* Professional workflow (merge, pull requests, fork, .gitignore, deployment)
* Multiple work environments on Git (rebase, stash, clean, cherry-pick)
